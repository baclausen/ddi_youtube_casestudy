explains your project.  

Deliverables
Presentation
Your group will present your results to the class from a slide deck presentation. Your presentation should include:
•	Clearly state the goal of your project (what were you exploring?)
•	Clearly state a projected possible benefit to your inquiry
o	e.g. Knowing this will help us make more strategically targeted decisions
•	Describe the data.
o	What features (columns) did you have to work with?
o	What features were you interested in?
o	Were the features numerical/categorical/text?
o	Was a lot of data missing? If so, what did you do to handle it?
o	How did features relate to each other, and the values that you were interested in?
o	Use plots to clearly communicate the data's story to stakeholders.

A repository including a README.md file
Your group repository will contain any notebooks and Python script files you used to complete your analysis. It should also contain a comprehensive README.md file. The README.md markdown file should be a written recap of the type of information you will be presenting. It may have sections that further explain your choices. Include any illustrations and graphics you will use in the presentation.
Readers of the file should be able to get a good sense of your project even without a presentation.
Create the readme and presentation as you go
It's a common habit that students wait to create their presentations and readme until the last possible moment.
You will have a significantly better experience if you craft these as you go.
