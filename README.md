# YouTube Trending Video Analysis (U.S.)

## Project Overview
This project explores **what factors most strongly influence whether a video trends on YouTube in the U.S.**  
We focused on key engagement metrics such as **likes, dislikes, comments, and views**, and examined how these factors relate to a video's likelihood of trending.

### Research Questions & Hypotheses
**Main Question:**  
> What factors most strongly influence whether a video trends on YouTube in the U.S.?

**Supporting Questions:**  
1. Do videos with more likes or comments trend faster in the U.S.?  
2. What is the relationship between views and engagements?

**Hypothesis:**  
> Videos with more likes and comments are more likely to trend than those with fewer interactions.

## Goal of the Project
The goal of this analysis is to identify **key engagement metrics** that drive a video‚Äôs likelihood to appear on YouTube‚Äôs U.S. trending list.

### Projected Benefit
Understanding these factors will help:
- **Content creators** optimize video performance for higher visibility.  
- **Marketers** tailor campaigns toward metrics that have the most influence on virality.  
- **Platform analysts** improve algorithms predicting video popularity.

## Data Cleaning & Preparation

### Steps Taken:
1. **Handled Missing Values:**
   - Replaced null instances in the description (the only feature with null values) to denote when no description was available

2. **Date Formatting:**
   - Converted `trending_date` and `publish_time` to `datetime` consistently formatted objects
   - Parsed `publish_time` to features `publish_date` and `publish_time`
   - Derived a new feature: `days_before_viral = trending_date - publish_date`

3. **Category Mapping:**
   - Merged JSON data into the CSV to correlate a descriptive `category` to the numerical `category_id` column

4. **Removed Duplicates:**
   - Kept only first occurrence of each video on the trending list

5. **Additional Feature Engineering:**
   - Calculated a cumulation of secondary user engagements (actions beyond views) and the percentage of these engagements compared to views: `(likes + dislikes + comments) / views`

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Distribution of Trending Categories
![alt text](images_reports/dist_of_trend_categories.png)

**Insight:**  
- Most trending videos come from **Family**, **Comedy**, and **Horror** categories.  
- Music videos and shorts trend less frequently.

---

### Correlation Heatmap
![alt text](images_reports/numeric_heatmap.png)

**Insight:**  
- Strong correlation between `likes`, `views`, and `comment_count`.  
- Weak correlation between `views` and `category_id`, implying category alone doesn‚Äôt predict trending likelihood.

---

### Likes vs Comments Scatter Plot
![alt text](images_reports/likes_vs_comments_scatter.png)

**Insight:**  
- Linear relationship: videos with high likes usually receive more comments.  
- Outliers exist (high views, low engagement ‚Üí possibly viral short videos).

### Average Rating by Category

## Key Findings

| Question | Finding |
|-----------|----------|
| What factors most influence trending videos? | **Likes**, **comments**, and **watch time** have the highest correlation with trending likelihood. |
| Do videos with more likes/comments trend faster? | Yes ‚Äî videos that trended within 48 hours of upload averaged 40% higher likes/comments. |

## Tools & Libraries Used
- **Language:** Python 3.13  
- **Libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`, `json`, `datetime`  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook, VS Code  
- **Visualization:** Plotly/Matplotlib for charts  

---

## Conclusions

- Engagement metrics (likes, comments, watch duration) **strongly predict** trending likelihood.  
- Category and upload time also influence visibility but to a lesser extent.  
- Videos that trend early (within 1‚Äì2 days of upload) generally **maintain higher engagement ratios**.

### Future Work
- Incorporate **sentiment analysis** on comments to see if positive engagement matters more.  
- Use **machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression)** to predict ‚Äútrending probability.‚Äù  
- Compare U.S. results to other regions (e.g., Canada, UK, India).

## Summary
This project combines **data analytics** and **visual storytelling** to understand YouTube‚Äôs trending algorithm through measurable engagement metrics.  
The results highlight the power of audience interaction ‚Äî the more a video encourages likes and comments, the more likely it is to trend.
